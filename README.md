My mother always told me the direct translation of my russian name would have been John. Fortuitous indeed.

To me, AI doesn't appear as a net good for society. Impacts on the job market, power comsumption, youth attention span, and the eventual live action Terminator remake. However, I would like to better understand AI for these enevitable futures we're all sprinting towards. Because who knows, there may come a time I have to change my last name to Carter.

This repo is dedicated to my development in ML/AI and anything I find interesting along the way.

Daily commits should reflect my commitment to improvment. Whether they be notes on books being read or progress on projects being worked on.

My current experience (01/17/2026) is base level. I graduated with a degree in CS, but have only now found a genuine interest in learning about the subject. Specifically the subject of ML/AI. So interesting how goals set by attending universities produce an inherently anti-learning environment, but rather a pro-grade environment.

This subject comes easy to me, at least in contrast with any other cerebral endevour. So, I am confident I can earn the Carter name, in due time.

Hopefully, this repo will become a sort of roadmap for anyone looking to follow in my footsets. Those footsteps being transitioning from interests in programming, specifically machine learning and aritificial intelligence, into becoming a competant and knowledgable figure in the field.
