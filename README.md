My mother always told me the direct translation of my russian name would have been John. How fortuitous.

To me, AI doesn't appear as a net good for society. Impacts on the job market, power comsumption, youth attention span, and the eventual live action Terminator remake. However, I would like to better understand AI for these enevitable futures we're all sprinting towards. Because who knows, there may come a time I have to change my last name to Carter.

This repo is dedicated to my development in AI/ML and anything I find interesting along the way.

I will commit time daily as will be reflected in my hopefully daily commits. Whether it be books I am reading or projects I am workng on.

My experience is base level. I graduated with a degree in CS, but have only now found a genuine interest in learning about the subject. Specifically the subject of ML/AI.

The subject comes easy to me, at least in contrast with any other cerebral endevour. So, I am confident I can earn the Carter name, in due time.

Hopefully, this repo will become a sort of roadmap for anyone looking to follow in my footsets. Those footsteps being transitioning from interests in programming, specifically machine learning and aritificial intelligence, into becoming a competant and knowledgable persona in the field.

No LLMs were harmed in the making of this README.
